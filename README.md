## Want to Help me become a better programmer?

First off, you are awesome for that.

Send me a message about how I could improve my coding style or my CS problem solving skills.

**OR** help me solve the problems that I didn't get to finish which are located outside each package's respective 'completed' folder.

Thanks!
